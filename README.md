# MealPrep Assistant - Meal Organizer

### Project Description  
**MealPrep Assistant** is a **Tkinter** application developed in **Python** to **plan, organize, and manage meals** interactively.  
The project was designed **in French**, and the source code is **fully commented in French**.  

### Objectives  
- The program prevents input errors (e.g., non-numeric values, exceeding planned quantities).  
- **Set objectives**: The user can define the number of people, appetizers, main courses, desserts, and drinks.  
- **Add meals** by categorizing them, specifying who brings them with their name and surname, and indicating the quantity while respecting the defined objectives. For example, it is not possible to add more main courses than the specified number.  
- **Visualize planned meals** in a graphical interface.  
- **Modify and/or delete appetizers, main courses, desserts**, and/or their details while respecting constraints.  
- **Track progress** using **interactive colored bars**:  
  - **Red**: Less than 40% of meals are planned.  
  - **Orange**: Between 40% and 70%.  
  - **Yellow**: Between 70% and 99%.  
  - **Green**: 100% of the planned meals are reached.
